Their utility has made PowerBI and Tableau household names. And while these solutions do support `R` and `Python` scripts and visualizations, the `Flexdashboard` package seeks to compete. The `Flexdashboard` packages does this all in `R` with the simplicity of writing a `R Markdown` file.\n\n## Initial Setup\n\nThe setup is simple, you just need to download and load the `Flexdashboard` package. With the package installed, the easiest way to start is by creating a new `R Markdown` file using the `Flexdashboard` template. Loading the `Shiny` package is useful if you would like to use interactive plots, but it is not necessary.\n\nThe dashboard can be laid out by either columns or by rows, it doesn't really make a difference. Just change the text of columns with rows in the following walk-through. A column is set up with \"\\## Column\" as the header. The size of the plot region can then be modified with \"{data-width=\"500\"}\" in the same header line. The next line should be the plot/area title, which is included with \"\\### Plot Title\" header. All that is left is to include a code chunk with your plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(flexdashboard)\nlibrary(shiny)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Sample Data\n\nI decided to demonstrate different dashboard features with a data set from `Open Canada` about charitable donations. More information can be found [here](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/74c77af4-73c4-4e0d-ac5d-f74a247cdf12)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndownload.file(\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/tbl/csv/45100007-eng.zip\", \"donordata.zip\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Sample Dashboard 1\n\nThe first dashboard was set up with the default columns layout. It includes an interactive bar chart, an interactive box plot and a pie chart. All the plot were created with `GGplot2`, the two plot were made interactive with the `GGplotly` function from the `Plotly` package. I created a pie chart to demonstrate the use of regular ggplots and because I recently read a complaint about `GGplot2` for the creation of Pie charts on Reddit. In my opinion, Pie charts are not very good very conveying information.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<iframe title=\"Demo 1\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" src=\"demo1.html\"></iframe>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Sample Dashboard 2\n\nFor the second dashboard, I used the row layout. The process is that same with no additional complications. The dashboard features an interactive Leaflet plot, an interactive histogram and data table using the `GT` package. The table was transformed with Pivot_Wider function to better fill the space.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<iframe title=\"Demo 2\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" src=\"demo2.html\"></iframe>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe `Flexdashboard` package can be used to create nice looking dashboards with a great level of control. The plots can also include interactive elements. When compared to PowerBi or Tableau, there remains one major deficiency. These other dashboards contain a smart interactive filter which ties all the plots together. If you select a specific element in one plot for filtering, all other plots have the same filter applied to them. This is a major boon for understanding data and not a simple feature to develop in `Flexdashboard`. It remains an interesting package, but I would still rely on PowerBI or Tableau to create dashboards.\n\n> Photo by [Luke Chesser](https://unsplash.com/@lukechesser?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/dashboards?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)\n",
