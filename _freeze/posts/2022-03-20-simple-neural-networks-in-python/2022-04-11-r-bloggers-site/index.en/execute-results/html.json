It is a vast collection of Blogs on everything that has to do will the R language. I would very much like to contribute to their work with this blog. \n\nJust to keep it interesting, I would like to recommend this specific post by [The Jumping Rivers Blog](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/04/upcoming-r-conferences-2022/) about upcoming R conferences. I've attended a few digital R Conferences, hosted by R-Studio, and they are very rewarding experiences. They have the ability to both inspire and educate. Unfortunately, there are no conferences in my native Canada.\n\n> Photo by [Andrew Neel](https://unsplash.com/@andrewtneel?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/bloggers?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)\n  \n",
