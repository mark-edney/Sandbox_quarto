Make sure that you update the fields in the yaml header. In particular you will want to update the `output` field to whatever format your template requires.\n\nThis is a good place to demonstrate special features that your template provides. Ideally it should knit out-of-the-box, or at least contain clear instructions as to what needs changing.\n\nFinally, be sure to remove this message!\n",
