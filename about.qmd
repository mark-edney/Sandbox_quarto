The Data Sandbox is a collection of Data Science projects and discussions on Data Science topics. These projects are based on *R* or *Python* code. The Sandbox was started in January 2022.

Mark Edney is the sole writer for all articles. He performs his own research, and all projects are those that he has completed from a selection of different Data Science certifications. He also manages the website. 

Mark is a Engineer in Training located in Toronto Ontario Canada. He has studied data science since 2019 but has programmed for years before that. He is proficient in *R*, *Python* and *Matlab* but has previously learned some *C* and *C++*. 

This website is created in *R* with the *blogdown* package. All assets are stored on Github and generously hosted by Netlify. For any inquires, please refer to the contact page.
