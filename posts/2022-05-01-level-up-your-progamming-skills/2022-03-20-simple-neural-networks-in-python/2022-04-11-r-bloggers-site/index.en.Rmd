I would like to take the time to mention the [r-bloggers](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://r-bloggers.com&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649728986132366&usg=AOvVaw2vAkyuJT7uhjS9BQpH-Upw) site. It is a vast collection of Blogs on everything that has to do will the R language. I would very much like to contribute to their work with this blog. 

Just to keep it interesting, I would like to recommend this specific post by [The Jumping Rivers Blog](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/04/upcoming-r-conferences-2022/) about upcoming R conferences. I've attended a few digital R Conferences, hosted by R-Studio, and they are very rewarding experiences. They have the ability to both inspire and educate. Unfortunately, there are no conferences in my native Canada.
